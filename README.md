## Neural Network model with spiking neurons and binary axon

<b>Membrane/b> is a c++ implementation of a neural network model compatible with Singularity decentralized optimization exhibiting:
<ul>
<li>
Axon spike train propagation
</li>
<li>

Synapses to any physical position on axon, changing phase of received spike train
</li>
<li>

Long Term and Short Term Plasticity

</li>
<li>
Per-neuron/Per-synapse activity-based epigenetic markers (usables in neuroevolution)
</li>
<li>
Per-neuron oscilation band threshold (several parallell oscilation bands in a neural network)
</li>
<li>
8 bit Neurotransmitters/receptors for separated neuroevolution of interacting circuit
<ul/>
